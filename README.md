# Intraday Daytrading Experiment

In this third-year university project for Trading, Market Design & Application, I simulate the role of an intraday trader by back and forward testing a trading strategy that uses a (6,24,3) MACD technical indicator. During the back testing of this trading strategy i download past market data from Yahoo Finance, and perform data manipulation to stitch and reformat the data into a format inputable to a python function built to mimic the trading strategy set out in this project. 


The accompanying Technical Report describes the experiments process and discusses my findings. Please download the Excel file for the experiments outcome and see the PDF file for the detailed Technical Report.
